## Introduction

Docker simplifies the process of developing, shipping, and running applications. Combined with **FastAPI**, a high-performance Python web framework, you can create modern APIs effortlessly. In this blog, we'll:

1. Understand a **Dockerfile** line by line.
2. Explore a sample **FastAPI** code snippet.

---

## The Dockerfile

Here’s a simple copy paste Dockerfile for deploying a FastAPI application:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /code
COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt
COPY ./app /code/app
CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80"]
```

## Sample FastAPI Code


Here’s a simple FastAPI application:


```python
from typing import Union
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

## Directory Structure 

```
project/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
```

## Breaking Down the Dockerfile

Let’s take a detailed look at the **Dockerfile** step by step:

### 1. `FROM python:3.9`

This line specifies the base image. It uses the official Python image with version **3.9**.  
The base image includes Python pre-installed, saving you the hassle of setting it up manually.

---

### 2. `WORKDIR /code`

This sets the **working directory** inside the container to `/code`.  
Any subsequent commands (e.g., `COPY`, `RUN`) will be executed relative to this directory.

---

### 3. `COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt`

This copies the `requirements.txt` file from your local system to the container at `/code/requirements.txt`.  
The `requirements.txt` file lists all the dependencies your Python project needs.

---

### 4. `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt`

This installs the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using **pip**.

- **`--no-cache-dir`**: Ensures no temporary files are cached, reducing the image size.  
- **`--upgrade`**: Updates all dependencies to their latest compatible versions.

---

### 5. `COPY ./app /code/app`

This copies the `app` directory from your local machine to `/code/app` inside the container.  
The `app` directory typically contains your FastAPI application files.

---

### 6. `CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80"]`

This specifies the command the container will execute when it starts:

- **`fastapi run`**: Runs the FastAPI application.  
- **`app/main.py`**: The entry point to your FastAPI app.  
- **`--port 80`**: Exposes the application on port **80** inside the container.

---
### Now use these following commands to build and run the container:

```
docker build -t fastapi-app .
```
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 fastapi-app
```

### Open Your Browser and go to localhost you should see something like this :

```json
{"Hello": "World"}
```

## Conclusion

This step-by-step breakdown helps you understand each line of the **Dockerfile** and its role in building and deploying a FastAPI application. With this knowledge, you can confidently build Docker images for your projects.
