# Run DeepSeek R1 Locally for Free in Just 3 Minutes!

DeepSeek-R1 has been making waves in the AI community. Developed by DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, this model is being compared to top-tier OpenAI models. The best part? It's open-source! You can download and run it locally for free. In this guide, Iâ€™ll show you how to set up DeepSeek-R1 on your system using Ollama.

## Why Choose DeepSeek-R1?

DeepSeek-R1 stands out because:

- It's cost-effective compared to many proprietary models.
- It excels in reasoning, problem-solving, and coding tasks.
- It features built-in chain-of-thought reasoning, improving response accuracy.
- Itâ€™s open-source, giving you full control over deployment.

Let's dive into how you can get this model running on your local system.

## Getting Started with Ollama

Before running DeepSeek-R1, we need Ollama. Ollama is an open-source tool that enables users to run LLMs (Large Language Models) locally.

### Step 1: Install Ollama

First, download and install Ollama based on your OS:

- Visit [Ollamaâ€™s official website](https://ollama.ai) and download the installer.
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once installed, verify by running:

```sh
ollama --version
```
### Step 2: Download DeepSeek-R1
Now, install DeepSeek-R1 by running the following command:
```sh
 ollama run deepseek-r1 
```
This will download and install the DeepSeek-R1 model. The process may take a few minutes, depending on your internet speed.
### Step 3: Verify Installation
To check if DeepSeek-R1 was installed successfully, use:
```sh
ollama list 
```
If you see `deepseek-r1` in the list, youâ€™re good to go!
### Step 4: Run DeepSeek-R1 Locally
To start using DeepSeek-R1, simply run:

```sh
ollama run deepseek-r1 
```
Now, you can interact with the AI model locally. Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve successfully set up DeepSeek-R1 on your machine.
## Final Thoughts
Running DeepSeek-R1 locally is a game-changer for AI developers. It provides privacy, speed, and flexibility without relying on cloud-based solutions. Whether you're experimenting with AI or integrating it into a project, this setup ensures complete control over your AI environment.
Try it out and explore the possibilities of local AI processing!
