# Welcome to My Blog!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Sujal Bhavsar**, a Computer Engineering student and a passionate **Full Stack Developer**. Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work on projects that span across web development, AI, backend systems, and more, and Iâ€™m thrilled to share my journey with you.

## Why This Blog? 

Over the years, Iâ€™ve explored a wide range of technologies, participated in hackathons, and built projects that have pushed me to grow as a developer. I wanted a space to document these experiences, share insights, and connect with others in the tech community. Whether you're a developer, student, or just someone curious about tech, I hope youâ€™ll find value here!

## What Can You Expect? 

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what Iâ€™ll be writing about:
- **Project Highlights:** Deep dives into my projects like [MarketMitra](#), live-pasting apps, AI tools, and more.
- **Tech Tutorials:** Tutorials and guides on technologies like **React**, **Spring Boot**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **AWS**, and more.
- **Career Journey:** Tips and lessons Iâ€™ve learned on becoming a full-stack developer.
- **Creative Ideas:** Fun and unique project ideas (like a collaborative music streaming app or gamified metaverse UI) that you can build, too.

## Recent Work I'm Excited About 

Some of my recent projects include:
1. **Deployly**: A platform for seamless deployment of repositories.
2. **Collaborative Music Streaming App**: Real-time playlist curation with reactions and voting, powered by WebSockets and the Spotify API.
3. **Movie Recommendation System**: A smart system that suggests movies and displays posters based on user preferences.

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/sujal011) to see these and more in action!
