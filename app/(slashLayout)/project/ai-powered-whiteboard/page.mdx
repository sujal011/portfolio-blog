## The Vision

Our AI-powered whiteboard offers features such as:

- **Visual Diagram Generation**: Automatically create flowcharts, mind maps, and other visual aids.
- **Math and Physics Problem Solving**: Input scenarios through drawings or equations and receive instant solutions.
- **Interactive Note-Taking**: Generate educational checklists and explanations for programming topics.
- **Real-Time Coding Assistance**: Solve coding problems and receive snippets in programming languages like Python.

This platform enhances productivity and promotes an intuitive way to learn and solve problems.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. **Diagramming Made Easy**
   - Draw rough flowcharts or mind maps, and let the AI transform them into polished diagrams.
   - Save and export diagrams for project planning or presentations.

### 2. **Mathematical Problem Solving**
   - Input shapes like triangles or physical scenarios directly onto the board.
   - For example, draw a Pythagoras triangle with side lengths and let the AI calculate the hypotenuse.
   - Use physics-based drawings to analyze real-world problems, such as calculating collision time.

### 3. **Educational Assistance**
   - Request programming checklists (e.g., Python topics) and track your progress by ticking items off.
   - Ask the AI for explanations of coding concepts like dictionaries, complete with code snippets.

### 4. **Coding Assistance**
   - Input equations, such as `2x + y = ?`, and receive quick solutions.
   - Request coding snippets, such as generating the Fibonacci series, and get working Python code instantly.
